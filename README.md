# Ethnic origin on those who died at Auschwitz

## Overview

We create a Shiny app that evaluates the ethnic background of those who died at Auschwitz. We further engage on a discussion on American slavery, based on article by [Jamelle Bouie](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/opinion/slavery-voyages-data-sets.html).





## Statement on LLM usage

We used ChatGPT for coding help on the Shiny app and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
